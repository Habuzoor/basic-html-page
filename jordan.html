                    <h2>About Jordan</h2>
                    <p>Jordan (Arabic: الأردن; tr. Al-ʾUrdunn [al.ʔur.dunː]), officially the Hashemite Kingdom of
                        Jordan,[a] is a country in Western Asia. It is situated at the crossroads of Asia, Africa and
                        Europe,[8] within the Levant region, on the East Bank of the Jordan River. Jordan is bordered by
                        Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the northeast, Syria to the north, and the
                        Palestinian West Bank, Israel, and the Dead Sea to the west. It has a 26 km (16 mi) coastline on
                        the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea to the southwest. The Gulf of Aqaba separates Jordan from
                        Egypt.[9] Amman is Jordan's capital and largest city, as well as its economic, political, and
                        cultural centre.[10]</p>
                    <p>
                        Modern-day Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. Three stable
                        kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom. Later rulers include
                        the Assyrian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Nabataean Kingdom, the Persian Empire, the Roman Empire,
                        the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid Caliphates, and the Ottoman Empire. After the Great Arab
                        Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by
                        Britain and France. The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then
                        Emir, Abdullah I, and the emirate became a British protectorate. In 1946, Jordan became an
                        independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan, but it was renamed
                        in 1949 to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the
                        1948 Arab–Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967. Jordan renounced its
                        claim to the territory in 1988, and became the second Arab state to sign a peace treaty with
                        Israel in 1994.[11] Jordan is a founding member of the Arab League and the Organisation of
                        Islamic Co-operation. The sovereign state is a constitutional monarchy, but the king holds wide
                        executive and legislative powers.</p>

                    <p>Jordan is a semi-arid country, covering an area of 89,342 km2 (34,495 sq mi), with a population
                        of 10 million, making it the eleventh-most populous Arab country. The dominant majority, or
                        around 95% of the country's population, is Sunni Muslim, with a mostly Arab Christian minority.
                        Jordan has been repeatedly referred to as an "oasis of stability" in the turbulent region of the
                        Middle East. It has been mostly unscathed by the violence that swept the region following the
                        Arab Spring in 2010.[12] From as early as 1948, Jordan has accepted refugees from multiple
                        neighbouring countries in conflict. An estimated 2.1 million Palestinian and 1.4 million Syrian
                        refugees are present in Jordan as of a 2015 census.[4] The kingdom is also a refuge to thousands
                        of Christian Iraqis fleeing persecution by the Islamic State.[13][14] While Jordan continues to
                        accept refugees, the recent large influx from Syria placed substantial strain on national
                        resources and infrastructure.[15]</p>

                    <p>Jordan has a high Human Development Index, ranking 102nd, and is considered an upper middle
                        income economy. The Jordanian economy, one of the smallest economies in the region, is
                        attractive to foreign investors based upon a skilled workforce.[16] The country is a major
                        tourist destination, also attracting medical tourism due to its well developed health
                        sector.[17] Nonetheless, a lack of natural resources, large flow of refugees and regional
                        turmoil have hampered economic growth.[18]</p>
